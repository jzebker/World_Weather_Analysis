## Overview
Help with the PlanMyTrip beta:

  [Deliverable 1:](https://github.com/jzebker/World_Weather_Analysis/tree/main/weather_database) Create a new DataFrame with the weather description added to the weather data you’ve already retrieved.
  
  [Deliverable 2:](https://github.com/jzebker/World_Weather_Analysis/tree/main/vacation_search) Have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences and use these preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.
  
  (Deliverable 3) Have the beta tester choose four cities to create a travel itinerary and, using the Google Maps Directions API, create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
